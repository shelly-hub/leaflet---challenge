# leaflet---challenge

## Project Aim
This challenge is to develop world earthquake visualisation through the use of leaflet javascript library.

## Project Description
This project utilises earthquake data provided by United States Geological Survey (USGS). USGS has provided timely set of data in GeoJson format. The past 30 days set of earthquake data is chosen to be used in this challenge.

Two folders are created in this challenge named as Leaflet-Part-1 and Leaflet-Part-2.
 - Leaflet-Part-1 visualises just earthquake data
 - Leaflet-Part-2 visualises earthquake data points with its relative location on tectonic plates
